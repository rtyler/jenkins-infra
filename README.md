# Jenkins Infra

[![Build Status](https://ci.jenkins.io/job/Infra/jenkins-infra/production/badge/icon)](https://ci.jenkins.io/job/Infra/jenkins-infra/production)

This repository is the [r10k](https://github.com/adrienthebo/r10k) control
repository for the [Jenkins](https://jenkins.io) project's own
infrastructure.

## Local development

The amount of testing that can be done locally is as follows:

 * `bundle install` - To get the necessary gems to run tests locally, if you're
   unfamiliar with Ruby development you may want to use [RVM](http://rvm.io/)
   to create an isolated Ruby environment
 * `./check` - Will run the
   [rspec-puppet](http://rspec-puppet) unit tests and the
   [puppet-lint](http://puppet-lint.com) style validation. If you intend to run
   the rspec-puppet over and over, use `rake spec_standalone` to avoid
   re-initializing the Puppet module fixtures every time.

### Vagrant-based testing

#### Pre-requisites

 * Import your SSH public key into a [key
   pair](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/ec2-key-pairs.html)
   into the `us-west-2` region. We have an AMI in us-west-2 that has Ubuntu 12.04,
   Puppet and a Docker-capable kernel installed for testing
 * Make sure your `default` [security
   group](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/using-network-security.html)
   allows SSH (port 22) from the outside world.
 * Run the `./vagrant-bootstrap` script locally to make sure your local
   environment is prepared for Vagranting

#### Running server spec tests

We're using [serverspec](http://serverspec.org) for on-machine acceptance
testing. Combined with Vagrant, this allows us to create an acceptance test
[per-role](dist/role/manifests) which provisions and tests an entire Puppet
catalog on a VM.

##### Pre-requisites

* Install [Vagrant](https://www.vagrantup.com)
* Install Vagrant plugins: `vagrant plugin install vagrant-aws  vagrant-serverspec`

To launch a test instance, `vagrant up ROLE` where `ROLE` is [one of the defined roles](dist/role/manifests).
You can rerun puppet and execute tests with `vagrant provision ROLE` repeatedly while the VM is up and running.
To just rerun serverspect without puppet, `vagrant provision --provision-with serverspec ROLE`.
When it's all done, deprovision the instance via `vagrant destroy ROLE`.

### Updating dependencies

This module maintains the list of Puppet module dependencies in `Puppetfile`
and `.fixtures.yml`. The `Puppetfile` is used by r10k for provisioning whereas
`.fixtures.yml` is only used by the rspec-puppet system to ensure that
appropriate module dependencies are present when compiling catalogues. They
need to be kept in sync. When you modify them, you can have the local
environment reflect changes by running `bundle exec rake resolve`.

## Branching model

The default branch of this repository is `staging` which is where pull requests
should be applied to by default.


```

+----------------+
| pull-request-1 |
+-----------x----+
             \
              \ (review and merge, runs acceptance tests)
staging        \
|---------------o--x--x--x---------------->
                          \
                           \ (manual merge, auto-deploys to prod hosts)
production                  \
|----------------------------o------------->
```

The branching model is a little different than what you might be familiar with.
We merge pull requests into a special branch called `staging` where we can run
Puppet acceptance tests from. Once somebody has code reviewed a pull request it
can be merged into `staging`.

When a infra project team member is happy with the code in `staging` they can
create a merge from `staging` to `production`. Once something has been merged
to production, it will be automatically deployed to production hosts.

## Installing agents

For installing agents refer to the [installing
agents](http://docs.puppetlabs.com/pe/latest/install_agents.html) section of
the PuppetLabs documentation.

## Adding a new branch/environment

"Dynamic environments" are in a bit of flux for the current version (3.7) of
Puppet Enterprise that we're using. An unfortunate side-effect of this is that
creating a branch in this repository is *not* sufficient to create a dynamic
environment that can be used via the Puppet master.

The enable an environment, add a file on the Puppet master:
`/etc/puppetlabs/puppet/environments/my-environment-here/environment.conf` with
the following:

```conf
modulepath = ./dist:./modules:/opt/puppet/share/puppet/modules
manifest = ./manifests/site.pp
```
